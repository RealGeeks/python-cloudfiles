python-cloudfiles
=================

IMPORTANT NOTE:
The python-cloudfiles bindings are no longer being maintained and their
use is deprecated. They will not be available after August 1, 2013.

We recommend that you use the pyrax bindings; this supports
all of the Rackspace cloud products, and not just Cloud Files.
See http://docs.rackspace.com/sdks/guide/content/python.html to download or to contribute.


Please also see https://github.com/openstack/python-swiftclient for the official swift OpenStack Bindings.
